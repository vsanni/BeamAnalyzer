TODO
* Decimate data for fitting
* optional: Update plots when units are changed and fitting is not running
* Add initial procedure to select camera with check parameters that cannot be retrieved automatically
* Add a Run buttton
* Separate data fitting and saving from live feeds by using a software interrupt o a mechanism different from the software timeout of the event loop
